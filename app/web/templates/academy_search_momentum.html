        <h1>What Is Search Momentum?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Search momentum shows how fast a search term is rising or falling in marketplace demand —
          not just how big it is today, but where it is heading.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-it-means">What does “search momentum” mean?</h2>
        <p>
          Most people only look at total search volume. That tells you <strong>how many</strong> people
          are searching right now – but it doesn’t tell you whether the demand is
          <strong>heating up</strong>, <strong>cooling down</strong>, or <strong>already peaking</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search momentum focuses on the <strong>direction and speed</strong> of a trend.
          When a search term keeps increasing week after week, it has
          <strong>positive momentum</strong>. When it slows down or drops, it has
          <strong>negative momentum</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why marketplace sellers should care</h2>
        <p>
          If you only chase high-volume searches, you usually enter markets that are already crowded.
          Momentum helps you see opportunities <strong>earlier</strong>, when competition is still lower
          and there is room to grow.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>High volume + flat momentum → usually late and saturated.</li>
          <li>Moderate volume + strong rising momentum → early-stage opportunity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With momentum you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spot search terms that are quietly gaining demand.</li>
          <li>Avoid niches that are clearly slowing down.</li>
          <li>Time product decisions with data instead of guesswork.</li>
          <li>See when seasonal waves are starting earlier than expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-its-calculated">How search momentum is calculated</h2>
        <p>
          Uptrend Hunter analyzes <strong>multiple weeks of marketplace search data</strong> and tracks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Week-over-week direction</li>
          <li>Rate of change over time</li>
          <li>Consistency across several weeks</li>
          <li>Acceleration or slowdown in demand</li>
          <li>Seasonal patterns and recurring spikes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When these signals align in a strong, sustained uptrend, the term receives a
          <strong>high momentum score</strong>. If the signals are mixed or weak, the momentum stays low.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-sellers-use-it">How sellers use momentum in real life</h2>
        <p>Search momentum helps sellers make cleaner decisions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Validate product ideas</strong> before committing inventory.</li>
          <li><strong>Find rising niches</strong> earlier than competitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust ad bids</strong> based on real demand signals.</li>
          <li><strong>Scale up</strong> when momentum is strong and consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Pull back</strong> when a term clearly starts cooling off.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Instead of guessing, you use data to answer:
          <strong>“Is demand for this search term actually growing right now?”</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-uptrend-hunter">Why Uptrend Hunter tracks momentum for you</h2>
        <p>
          Manually comparing weeks of data in spreadsheets is slow. Uptrend Hunter automates momentum
          analysis so you can spot rising opportunities earlier and reduce wasted ad spend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Momentum turns raw marketplace data into a clear, actionable signal —
          so you can move earlier and with more confidence.
        </p>
